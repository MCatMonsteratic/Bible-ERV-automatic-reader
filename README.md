This is my first Github project: a Bible, but split in verses, openable with a python file, which is started by a .bat-file.
For this project I used ChatGPT to make the code for seperating everything, that code is also in the files in this project.
For the Bible i used https://openbible.com/textfiles/erv.txt.
If you want to split the files, you need to edit the directories in the code, because i used an absolute path, only working for my PC.

Warning: You should unzip the .zip file, otherwise the .bat won't work.

The unzipping works a little weird, first unzip the main file, then go into the file and unzip Bible.zip.
