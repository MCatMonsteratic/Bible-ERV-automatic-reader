This is my first Github project: a Bible, but split in verses, openable with a python file, which is started by a .bat-file.
For this project I used ChatGPT to make the code for seperating everything, that code is also in the files in this project.
For the Bible i used https://openbible.com/textfiles/erv.txt.
If you want to split the files, you need to edit the directories in the code, because i used an absolute path, only working for my PC.

Warning: You should unzip the .zip file, otherwise the .bat won't work.

The unzipping works a little weird, first unzip the main directory, then go into the directory until you meet Bible.zip and then unzip that file. After that you can put the Bible directory out of the weird starting directory: Bible-ERV-automatic-reader-main.zip.

Click the .bat file to run the code. If something doesn't work well, or anything is not hufterproof, please tell me.
