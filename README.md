This is my first Github project: a Bible, but split in verses, openable with a python file, which is started by a .bat-file.
For this project I used ChatGPT to make the code for seperating everything, that code is also in the files in this project.
For the Bible i used https://openbible.com/textfiles/erv.txt.

Warning: You should unzip the .zip file, otherwise the .bat won't work.
